  description: Maintain a standard set of branch protection rules across Repositories
  long_description: |
    GitHub allows each Repository to maintain it's own set of branch protection rules.
    - when the skill detects a new Repos, the standard rules are configured
    - existing Repos are periodically checked to ensure that the standard set of Labels are present.
